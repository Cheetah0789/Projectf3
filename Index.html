<p>My favourite hobbey is,"Swimming".I like swimming most because,it is so fun when you dip your body so gently into the water and move your arms gracefully to glide around. I started swimming when I was 6 years old,at first I was so scared to even jump in the water.After a few months of class I got the hang of it.One they had a competiton,and I was in it.But at the very end guess who won the race.....I DID! and I got a medal and I was so proud of myself.And I have been going to swimming classes ever since.Now I stopped cause well I learned everything I needed to and finished all the levels.This is why swimming is my favourite hobby.</p>
